# AI-Voice-Clone-and-realtime-speech-to-text-and-text-to-speech
I need to attend Zoom or Teams calls, but have a set-up where I don't have to listen or speak natively through speaker and mic so I can attend multiple calls and interact when needed.

Ideal: I'm looking for a set-up where I can have audio out and in coming from one computer into a second computer (or specialized device) where speech-to-text is displayed in real-time from what is being said in the meeting. Then when someone starts talking to me I can answer with text-to-speech with a clone of my own voice. Usually, I'd only need to say a few words like, "Yes" or "I don't have any questions", etc. This would allow me to start the zoom on computer one, monitor the text output on computer 2, and type any answers/interactions.

I'm willing to pay for subscription services, I've seen multiple things out there that seem like they could do it like Eleven Labs but I need help setting it up.

Fall-back: If I could at least get the speech-to-text half (audio out) transcribed in real-time. that would be helpful. I'm open to hearing solutions that can

Key feature, this has to work over audio in/out connection to the first computer that is hosting the zoom or teams call with no software installed on that first computer.

To quickly achieve your setup for attending Zoom or Teams calls while interacting via text-to-speech, here's an overview of the solution components:
1. Audio Routing (Input/Output):

    Virtual Audio Cable (or similar software) will capture the system audio from Computer 1 (running the Zoom/Teams call) and send it to Computer 2.
        Tools: VB-Audio Virtual Cable (for Windows) or Soundflower (for macOS).
    Use this virtual audio cable to route the incoming audio (meeting audio) to a speech-to-text API (Google, Deepgram, OpenAI Whisper, etc.).

2. Speech-to-Text:

    Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or OpenAI Whisper to transcribe the meeting audio in real-time.
        Google Cloud: Offers high-quality real-time transcription.
        OpenAI Whisper: An open-source solution for transcribing speech.

Example for using Google Speech-to-Text:

from google.cloud import speech
import pyaudio

client = speech.SpeechClient()
stream = pyaudio.PyAudio().open(format=pyaudio.paInt16,
                                 channels=1,
                                 rate=16000,
                                 input=True,
                                 frames_per_buffer=1024)
audio_generator = iter(lambda: stream.read(1024), b"")
requests = (speech.StreamingRecognizeRequest(audio_content=content)
            for content in audio_generator)

responses = client.streaming_recognize(streaming_config, requests)

3. Text-to-Speech (Cloning Your Voice):

    Eleven Labs: Offers text-to-speech capabilities and even allows for custom voice cloning. After you get the transcribed text, you can feed it to Eleven Labs for text-to-speech.

Example using Google Cloud TTS:

from google.cloud import texttospeech

client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()
synthesis_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text="Yes")
voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(language_code="en-US", ssml_gender=texttospeech.SsmlVoiceGender.FEMALE)
audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3)

response = client.synthesize_speech(input=synthesis_input, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config)

with open("output.mp3", "wb") as out:
    out.write(response.audio_content)

4. Integration:

    Set up Computer 2 to listen to the audio via the virtual audio cable, perform real-time transcription, and use the transcribed text to trigger Text-to-Speech when you need to reply.
    Use Python or similar scripting to orchestrate the data flow from one system to another.

5. Working with No Software on First Computer:

    Youâ€™ll need virtual audio cable software on Computer 1 (Zoom/Teams host) and route the audio to Computer 2 where transcription and text-to-speech happen.
    Network communication: You can use a simple socket server to transmit the audio data between computers if needed.

Step-by-Step Workflow:

    Set Up Virtual Audio Cable on Computer 1 (Zoom/Teams).
    Transcribe audio on Computer 2 using Google Speech-to-Text or OpenAI Whisper.
    Generate a response using Eleven Labs or Google TTS on Computer 2.
    Playback response via speakers or virtual microphone on Computer 1.

Alternative Tools:

    Otter.ai: Can be used for transcription (real-time).
    Deepgram: Another transcription option that can be integrated into your workflow.

Quick Solution:

    Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable and route audio from Computer 1 to Computer 2.
    Implement Google Speech-to-Text or Whisper on Computer 2 for transcription.
    Implement Google TTS or Eleven Labs to reply with speech synthesis in your voice.
